I apologize for the confusion earlier. Since you want me to construct a letter in C++ code, I will provide you with a sample code that can be used to print a letter in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name = "John Doe";
    string date = "February 12, 2023";
    string subject = "Request for Extension on Assignment";
    string body = "Dear Professor, I am writing to request an extension on the upcoming assignment in your C++ programming course. Due to unforeseen personal circumstances, I have been unable to complete the assignment on time. I am confident that with an additional week, I will be able to complete the assignment to the best of my ability and meet the expected standards. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, " + name + " Date: " + date;

    cout << "Subject: " << subject << endl;
    cout << endl;
    cout << body << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code will print a letter with the subject "Request for Extension on Assignment" and the body of the letter. The name and date are also included in the letter.
