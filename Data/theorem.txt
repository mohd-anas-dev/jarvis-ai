Dear Professor,

I am writing to provide you with a theorem related to the Laplace transform of elementary functions. This theorem is particularly useful in simplifying the process of finding Laplace transforms of functions that involve sine, cosine, and exponential terms.

**Theorem:** Let f(t) be a function that can be expressed as a linear combination of sine and cosine terms, with exponential terms, and let L denote the Laplace transform operator. Then, the Laplace transform of f(t) can be written as:

L{f(t)} = ∫[0, ∞] f(t)e^(-st)dt

= ∫[0, ∞] [a sin(at) + b cos(at) + c e^(at)]e^(-st)dt

= aL{sin(at)} + bL{cos(at)} + cL{e^(at)}

where a, b, and c are constants, and L{sin(at)}, L{cos(at)}, and L{e^(at)} are the Laplace transforms of the sine, cosine, and exponential functions, respectively.

**Proof:**

We can prove this theorem by using the definition of the Laplace transform and the properties of the Laplace transform. Specifically, we can write:

L{f(t)} = ∫[0, ∞] f(t)e^(-st)dt

= ∫[0, ∞] [a sin(at) + b cos(at) + c e^(at)]e^(-st)dt

Using the properties of the Laplace transform, we can rewrite the integral as:

L{f(t)} = a ∫[0, ∞] sin(at)e^(-st)dt

+ b ∫[0, ∞] cos(at)e^(-st)dt

+ c ∫[0, ∞] e^(at)e^(-st)dt

Using the Laplace transforms of the sine, cosine, and exponential functions, we can simplify the above expression to:

L{f(t)} = aL{sin(at)} + bL{cos(at)} + cL{e^(at)}

This proves the theorem.

I hope this theorem is helpful in your future research. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

Sir
