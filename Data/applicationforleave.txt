Subject: Request for Leave from [Date] to [Date]

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a leave from [Date] to [Date] for personal reasons. I have an urgent matter that requires my attention and I will be unable to attend work during this period.

I have made sure to complete all my pending tasks and ensured a smooth transition of work before taking my leave. I will be available by email if any urgent matters arise during my absence.

I would be grateful if you could approve my leave request. Please let me know if there is any additional information required or if there are any concerns.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
