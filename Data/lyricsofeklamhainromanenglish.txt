Dear Friend,

I'm happy to provide you with the lyrics of the song "Ek Lamha" in Roman English. This beautiful song is from the Bollywood movie "Fitoor" and features the talented singer, Mohit Chauhan.

**Ek Lamha** (Roman English)

Mere khwabon ki duniya mein
Tum aaye, tum rahe, tum hai
Mere khwabon ki duniya mein
Tum aaye, tum rahe, tum hai

Kuch bhi nahin ki zaroorat hai
Mere paas tum ho, khushi hai
Kuch bhi nahin ki zaroorat hai
Mere paas tum ho, khushi hai

Ek lamha, ek lamha sa
Tum kabhi na mile, kabhi na mile
Ek lamha, ek lamha sa
Tum kabhi na mile, kabhi na mile

Mere khwabon ki duniya mein
Tum aaye, tum rahe, tum hai
Mere khwabon ki duniya mein
Tum aaye, tum rahe, tum hai

Kuch bhi nahin ki zaroorat hai
Mere paas tum ho, khushi hai
Kuch bhi nahin ki zaroorat hai
Mere paas tum ho, khushi hai

Translation:

"In the world of my dreams
You came, you stayed, you are
In the world of my dreams
You came, you stayed, you are

There's no need for anything else
I have you, I'm happy
There's no need for anything else
I have you, I'm happy

A moment, a moment like that
We may never meet, never meet
A moment, a moment like that
We may never meet, never meet

In the world of my dreams
You came, you stayed, you are
In the world of my dreams
You came, you stayed, you are

There's no need for anything else
I have you, I'm happy
There's no need for anything else
I have you, I'm happy"

I hope you enjoyed the lyrics! Let me know if you have any other requests or questions.

Best regards,

Sir
