Dear Professor,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous meeting, I am writing to provide you with a comprehensive list of formulas for transforms of elementary functions.

As you know, the Laplace transform is a powerful tool used to solve differential equations and other problems in mathematics and physics. However, applying the Laplace transform to elementary functions can be a bit tricky, especially for functions with multiple peaks or discontinuities. That's why I've compiled this list of formulas to help you navigate these challenges.

**1. Sine and Cosine**

The Laplace transform of the sine function is given by:

L{sin(at)} = a/(s^2 + a^2)

And the Laplace transform of the cosine function is given by:

L{cos(at)} = s/(s^2 + a^2)

**2. Exponential Functions**

The Laplace transform of the exponential function is given by:

L{e^(at)} = 1/(s-a)

**3. Gaussian Functions**

The Laplace transform of the Gaussian function is given by:

L{e^(-ax^2)} = 1/√(s+a)

**4. Error Functions**

The Laplace transform of the error function is given by:

L{erf(x)} = (1/√(πs)) * (1 - e^(-x^2s))

**5. Bessel Functions**

The Laplace transform of the Bessel function of the first kind is given by:

L{J0(x)} = 1/√(s^2 + 1)

**6. Logarithmic Functions**

The Laplace transform of the logarithmic function is given by:

L{ln|x|} = -∫(e^(-st)/t)dt

**7. Hyperbolic Functions**

The Laplace transform of the hyperbolic sine function is given by:

L{sinh(at)} = a/(s^2 - a^2)

And the Laplace transform of the hyperbolic cosine function is given by:

L{cosh(at)} = s/(s^2 - a^2)

I hope this list is helpful in your future endeavors. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

Sir
